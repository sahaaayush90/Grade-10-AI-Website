        <h2>What is AI?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> is the simulation of human intelligence by machines programmed 
            to mimic cognitive functions such as <i>learning, reasoning, and problem-solving</i>. AI is directly related to technological advancements, meaning what was considered AI 100 years ago may not be considered AI now. 
            Understanding AI’s history is essential to appreciating its evolution.
