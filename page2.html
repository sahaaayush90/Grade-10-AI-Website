        <h2>AI in Surgery</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> is revolutionizing surgery, enabling more precise, efficient, and safer procedures. 
            AI-powered tools analyze medical imaging, such as <i>CT</i> or <i>MRI scans</i>, to create highly detailed 3D models of a patient’s anatomy. 
            These models allow surgeons to simulate and plan complex procedures with precision, identifying risks and strategizing approaches before entering the operating room.

        <h3>Robotic Surgery: Da Vinci Surgical System</h3>
        <p>
            Robotic systems, such as the <b>da Vinci Surgical System</b>, incorporate AI to perform minimally invasive procedures. These robots translate a surgeon’s 
            hand movements into smaller, more accurate motions with enhanced precision. AI ensures stability and eliminates tremors, 
            making delicate procedures safer. For example, robotic-assisted surgeries in urology and gynecology have shown faster recovery times and fewer complications.

        <h3>Augmented Reality in Surgery</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Augmented Reality (AR)</b>, another type of AI in surgery, provides real-time guidance by processing live data during procedures, enhancing accuracy and safety. 
            For instance, AR overlays allow surgeons to visualize internal anatomy, such as blood vessels or organs, in greater detail. 
            AI systems can also analyze live imaging to identify critical areas like tumors or nerves, helping to avoid possible mishaps during surgery. 
            The more powerful of these tools can offer immediate feedback and suggestions, acting as a support system for surgeons, and potentially replacing 
            assistants or nurses in the future. By integrating this technology, surgeries become more precise, reducing risks and improving outcomes for patients.
